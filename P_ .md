# Packet Detective

### What is Wireshark?
Wireshark is a network packet analyzer. A network packet analyzer presents captured packet data in as much detail as possible.

You could think of a network packet analyzer as a measuring device for examining what’s happening inside a network cable, just like an electrician uses a voltmeter for examining what’s happening inside an electric cable (but at a higher level, of course).

In the past, such tools were either very expensive, proprietary, or both. However, with the advent of Wireshark, that has changed. Wireshark is available for free, is open source, and is one of the best packet analyzers available today.

### What is SMB protocol?
The Server Message Block protocol, or "SMB", is a remote file access protocol originally specified by Microsoft, IBM, and Intel. It's also referred to as the Common Internet File System, or "CIFS". It's one of the protocols most commonly used by DOS and Windows machines to access files on a file server.
SMB works as a client-server protocol, where a client makes requests to a server. It facilitates file and printer sharing between computers and allows remote file access.
With SMB, a user can access files or applications stored on a remote server as if they were local. Users can open, read, create, modify and delete files on the remote server.
SMB was originally designed by IBM in the 1980s to turn the local file access of DOS into a networked file system. It allowed files on separate computers to be accessed as if they were on the user’s local hard disk, by using a common network protocol.
The first version of SMB ran on top of NetBIOS using TCP/IP ports 137, 138 and 139. Software locating each other via NetBIOS names used TCP port 139 for NetBIOS session services.
