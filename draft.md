### Introduction to Azure Activity Logs and Elastic for Security Investigations

Azure Activity Logs provide a comprehensive record of actions taken by users, roles, or Azure services within the Azure environment. These logs capture detailed information about API calls made to Azure resources, including who made the call, the originating resource, and the actions performed.

For example, when an administrator creates a new virtual machine or modifies a network security group, Azure Activity Logs document this activity, offering crucial data for auditing and forensic analysis.

Understanding Azure Activity Logs is vital as they provide visibility into the operations of Azure services and applications. Think of them as security cameras for your cloud infrastructure, recording every action that occurs. This visibility is essential for:

- **Compliance**: Ensuring adherence to regulatory standards.
- **Security Investigation**: Tracing the source of security incidents or breaches.
- **Operational Troubleshooting**: Understanding actions that may impact system performance.

Azure Activity Logs are invaluable for forensic analysts, as they contain a detailed history of Azure service activities, which can be crucial for identifying unauthorized access or changes in the environment.

Elastic is a powerful platform designed to analyze large volumes of data, making it an ideal tool for examining Azure Activity Logs. With Elastic, you can efficiently search and visualize data from various sources, including Azure Activity Logs, enabling the identification of patterns, trends, and anomalies that can enhance your log analysis.

### Identifying and Investigating Unauthorized Access

In the vast cloud environment, security incidents such as unauthorized access pose significant threats to organizational assets and data. Cloud forensics in Azure involves techniques and methodologies to analyze security incidents occurring within Microsoft Azure. By focusing on Azure Activity Logs, we can gain insights into user activities and API usage, which are essential for tracing unauthorized access attempts and compromised accounts.

Unauthorized access often begins with a compromised account. Attackers may exploit weak passwords, conduct brute-force attacks, or utilize stolen credentials to gain access. Once inside, they can move laterally across the network, accessing sensitive data and resources. Identifying threats among potentially thousands of log entries requires a structured approach that starts broad and narrows down to specific anomalies.

1. **Start Broad**: Review all Azure Activity Log data within a specific timeframe. Consider what normal activity looks like and identify any outliers.
2. **Filter by Event Type**: Focus on authentication activities. Are there any anomalies, such as an unusual number of failed login attempts?
3. **Analyze Failures**: Aggregate failed login attempts to highlight potential unauthorized access.
4. **Spot the Anomaly**: Investigate isolated suspicious activities. Are there legitimate explanations for these failures, or do they indicate a compromised account?

To begin the investigation, concentrate on analyzing Azure Activity Logs through Elastic queries. These logs provide a targeted dataset for analysis. By focusing on authentication-related events, we can effectively pinpoint access attempts and potential compromises.

After identifying a potentially compromised account, the next step is to determine the scope of unauthorized access.

- **Define the Scope**: What does unauthorized access entail in your Azure environment? Is it limited to specific Azure Blob Storage containers, or does it extend to modifying role assignments?
- **Use Elastic to Isolate Events**: Investigate the actions of the compromised account. What resources were accessed or modified, and when did these activities occur?
- **Determine the Timeline**: Establishing a timeline of unauthorized activities helps understand the sequence of events. Utilize Elastic to sort and visualize this data effectively.
- **Evaluate the Impact**: Assess the sensitivity of the accessed data and the potential impact of the unauthorized access.

### Analyzing Configuration Changes and Unauthorized Persistence

Configuration changes in cloud environments, particularly those affecting security settings like Azure Storage access policies, can have significant implications. Unauthorized changes may expose sensitive data, leading to breaches. Monitoring and analyzing these changes is crucial for maintaining the security posture of your Azure environment.

Using Elastic, we can sift through Azure Activity Logs to identify any storage accounts modified to allow public access. Understanding how attackers exploit misconfigured settings to access sensitive data is critical, as public exposure can lead to serious financial and reputational damage.

- Narrow down the search to Azure Activity Logs.
- Filter for changes to access policies indicating modifications to public access settings.
- Refine the search to actions taken by suspected compromised accounts.
- Analyze results to identify affected resources.

Attackers often create new user accounts or modify group memberships to maintain persistence and elevate privileges within a compromised environment. Detecting these activities early can help mitigate damage.

To detect unauthorized user creation, focus on user creation events within Azure Activity Logs. Filter these events for analysis to identify accounts that may have been created by attackers.

To identify group modifications, look for changes in group membership to understand the access scope granted to unauthorized users.

When constructing and analyzing queries, itâ€™s essential to understand not just the "how" but also the "why." Each component of an Elastic query serves a specific purpose, from narrowing the focus to relevant logs to isolating events indicating security actions or concerns.

Understanding the purpose of each query allows for adaptation and modification as needed, empowering you to be not just a user of Elastic but a proficient analyst capable of navigating complex cloud environments.
